### Java Problem Question

1. Suppose, a=10 and b=20. Now swap the value without a temp variable. Output: a=20, b=10
2. Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75]
     Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score. (without sorting, use linear searching algorithm)
3. Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA (don’t use Arrays.sort() method, do it programmatically)
4. From the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm
5. Calculate and Print the MEDIAN of the CGPA
6. Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
7. Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount. Here is the notes in the given array:    
notes=[1000,500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]
Input: 546
Output:
500 1
20 2
5 1
1 1

8. Write a program that will give following output:    
1    
12    
123    
1234    
12345

9. Write a program that will shuffle (values will randomly change their position) from the given array    
numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]

10. Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. (Don’t use Arrays.sort() method)
11. Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string:
Input: I am a SQA Engineer
Output: 
Words: 5
Chars: 15
Vowel: 8
Consonant: 7

12. Print the duplicate numbers in the given array.
numbers=[1, 2, 3,1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 4]
Output: 
1 2 4

13. Here is the array of lucky draw numbers:
[100,150,140,180,170,200,250,230,220,300]
Now, input any number from this array. The program will randomly generate any one number of this array. If your input number and generated number matches, it will print you are lucky! Continue it max 3 times until you are lucky. If at the 1st or 2nd time you are lucky, then the program will quit instead of giving you a chance 3 times.

14. Write a program that will take integer numbers as user input continuously and print the sum of numbers until user input q from the keyboard. When user input q, the program will be quit. If the user inputs another character, then the program will ask to input the number again.

15. A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount? [Extract the digits from the paragraph and calculate the price]
